from balsam.api import ApplicationDefinition

"""
This script uses the Balsam API to define and sync two types of Balsam apps:
a libEnsemble app, and a Forces app:

    - The libEnsemble app runs the calling script ``run_libe_forces_balsam.py``.
      An input transfer is also specified, but parameterized in
      ``submit_libe_forces_balsam.py`` as part of the Job specification process.

    - The Forces app is defined and synced with Balsam. The libEnsemble app
      will submit instances of the Forces app to the Balsam service for scheduling
      on a running batch session at its site. An optional output transfer is defined;
      forces.stat files are transferred back to the Globus endpoint defined in
      run_libe_forces_balsam.py

Unless changes are made to these Apps, this should only need to be run once to
register each of these apps with the Balsam service.

If not running libEnsemble remotely, feel free to comment-out ``RemoteLibensembleApp.sync()``
